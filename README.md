## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a comprehensive model that leverages Python's data analysis libraries to predict housing prices in Boston. The model uses various features, including crime rates, average number of rooms, and accessibility to amenities. Understanding these factors can help stakeholders make informed decisions in the housing market.

## Features

- Predictive analysis of housing prices based on multiple variables.
- Visualizations of data to understand relationships between features.
- Interactive plots for better insights using Plotly and Seaborn.
- Easy-to-follow code structure for educational purposes.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies and libraries, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the regression model.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plots.
- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yoshinovia/Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model_.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model_
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the required packages, you can run the main script to start the analysis. 

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will run the model and generate the output files, including visualizations.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is derived from the Boston Housing dataset. It contains various features that influence housing prices. You can find a description of the dataset below:

- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- **TAX**: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **B**: \(1000(Bk - 0.63)^2\) where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town.
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status of the population.
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

You can find the dataset in the `data` folder of this repository.

## Model Explanation

The multivariable regression model is designed to predict the median value of homes based on the features mentioned above. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how the model works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The model begins by cleaning and preprocessing the data. Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection**: Important features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable (MEDV).

3. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the training dataset. We use Scikit-learn's Linear Regression for this purpose.

4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared value.

5. **Prediction**: Finally, the model can predict housing prices based on new input data.

## Results

The model produces various outputs, including:

- Visualizations that show the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Performance metrics that indicate how well the model predicts housing prices.
- A summary of important features that contribute to the prediction.

You can find the results in the `results` folder after running the model.
